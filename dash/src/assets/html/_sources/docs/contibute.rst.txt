Contributing your workflow to MLExchange
----------------------------------------

If you have a new model or workflow to use within the MLExchange services (e.g., image segmentation),
you can add it through the model registry following the steps below.

Model preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step to submit a new model in MLExchange is to dockerize your
script. To simplify this process, you can use the following templates:

Insert the maintainer’s name in line 2 in ``docker/Dockerfile``.

.. literalinclude:: mlex_templates/docker/Dockerfile


List the Python packages you utilized in your source code with their corresponding
versions in ``docker/requirements.txt``. 

.. literalinclude:: mlex_templates/docker/requirements.txt


Use ``src/model_name.py`` to place your algorithm. You can rename this
file according to your function/command, e.g. train.py. 
While modifying this template, please make sure to identify 3 main sections of your
code: input directory(ies), output directory(ies), and parameters.
The template indicates how to declare this information and the order in which they should be declared. 
If you have more than one input directory, you should list these directories consecutively. 
The same applies for the output directories.

.. literalinclude:: mlex_templates/src/model.py

Note: If you have more than one function/command, create another script with the same template, 
and save it with a different name, e.g. ``test.py``. 
Use ``src/model_validation.py`` to define the parameter classes (if you have any) that are used in your
source files. For validation purposes, MLExchange uses
`Pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io>`__. 

.. literalinclude:: mlex_templates/src/model_validation.py

Insert your project name in line 4 in Makefile (optional).
You can add example commands in Makefile. 
Once all changes have been completed, open a terminal console and type
“build_docker”. 
You have successfully dockerized your model!

.. literalinclude:: mlex_templates/Makefile

Model registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can register a new model at `MLExchange Model
Registry <https://mlsandbox.als.lbl.gov/model-registry>`__.

| **Register your model**

| Create a JSON file with the description of your model (fill out the
  online form to generate your model document), and upload your model
  document to the model registry after validating the document.
  
.. figure:: figures/upload_model.png
   :scale: 62 %

   :align: center

| **Parameter definition**

| The parameter class you previously defined for your source files
  corresponds to the GUI’s components that MLExchange automatically
  generates within its applications. You can define these parameters in
  the JSON file, or you can use the model registry form to add each GUI
  component.

Currently, the model registry supports the following 8 types of components: 

- 3 types of input box: int, float, and string
- Dropdown
- Slider
- RadioItem
- BooleanSwitch
- Graph

They look like the follows:
