# Introduction to MLExchange

MLExchange is an open source platform that deploys machine learning (ML) models for beamline scientists. This platform aims to encourage collaboration across user facilities, i.e., Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC).

MLExchange is designed to work as an ecosystem, with applications accessing services, databases, repositories, and others. The workflow of MLExchange can be further explained by tracing the submission and deployment of an ML model through its ecosystem, as follows:

A new ML model can be easily added to the current MLExchange platform through the **model registry**. Once the model is ingested into the MLExchange registry, the applications in the platform can deploy this new ML model among different datasets through it’s **computing service**. The computing service will deploy the requested model with its corresponding dataset in a suitable location that can provide the resources that the algorithm requires for it’s correct operation. Simultaneously, the user can access the status of these processes, its logs, and their final results from the web applications.

## Future work 
* Model recommendation and ranking  
* Data services
